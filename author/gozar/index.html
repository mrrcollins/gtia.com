                        Back in the late 90s I purchased a large Atari collection on eBay. It's been sitting in storage, just waiting for me to dig into it. I remember I bough it for the Spartados X cartridge and R-time 8, but didn't realize everything else that was in...

                        After seeing Bill Kendrick's Minijong I knew I had to go back and re-work GozMind. I stole.. I mean, borrowed, Bill's character redefinition ideas, and replaced the symbols with the number 1-6. The result is Crack My Luggage. Introduction Silly...
